This is the official repository of the GAMA platform, an open-source modeling and simulation environment for creating spatially explicit agent-based simulations. GAMA provides an IDE for its own language along with embedded powerful vizualisation capabilities. The goal is to provide an easy to learn but yet efficient environment covering the widest possible range of use cases for agent-based modelling.

For more detailed information about it, visit our [website](https://gama-platform.org).

**See the changelog on the [website](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/next/Changelog) for a detailed list of changes since version 1.9.0**  

## Installing GAMA

### Instal a release
There's a detailed tutorial that covers all cases in the [documentation](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Installation), but for most user you can just go straight to the [**releases**](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases) section of this repository and download the version that corresponds to your needs, we recommend you take a version bundled with a JDK.

### Run it from the source code

To run it from the source code you can either use `maven` to build the program yourself, or run it from `eclipse` in case you want to inspect the code and/or modify it. In both cases you will first need to **clone this repository** and to get the [Temurin distribution of JDK21](https://adoptium.net).

#### using eclipse

There is a more detailled explanation on the [website](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/InstallingGitVersion) about how to do so, here we will only give a fast and easy approach.

The _highly recommended configuration_ for working on this branch is [Eclipse for Java and DSL 2024-06](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2024-06/r/eclipse-ide-java-and-dsl-developers), using a different version may expose you to some bugs.

Once you have imported the code base into your workspace, simply open the `gama.product` project and open either `gama.headless.product` or `gama.product` depending if you want to run gama with or without GUI.
In the `Overview` pane of the file, click on `Synchronize` and then `Launch an Eclipse application` and GAMA should start.

#### using maven

First install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) on your computer, then open a terminal at the root of project and follow those steps:
1. go to the project `gama.annotations`
2. run the command:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. go to the project `gama.processor`
4. run the same mvn command
5. go to the project `gama.parent`
6. run the same mvn command one last time

The produced release should be stored in the project `gama.product` under the `target` folder.

## Reporting problems

If you noticed something wrong/not up-to-date or a lack of information on something on the website and the documentation you could create an issue on the website's dedicated repository here: [https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io/issues](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama-platform.github.io/issues)

For general questions about modelling/development on GAMA you can either ask them in the [discussions](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/discussions) of this repository or on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/gama-platform)

## Contributing

There are a few tutorials explaining how to create new functionalities in gama that you can find in the [developing extensions](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/DevelopingExtensions) section of the website, and one general explanation of the architecture of the software and important types used in the section [Introduction to GAMA Java API](https://gama-platform.org/wiki/Introduction-To-Gama-Java-API).

To contribute to the code you just have to submit a pull-request to this repository, if you encounter any problem to do so, feel free to ask about it either on the [github discussions](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/discussions) or the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/gama-platform).
