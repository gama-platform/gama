    <h2 class="with-bar-left">What is Gama Server Connector?</h2>
    <div class="text">
        This tool will help you understand how to use Gama Server. 
        It allows you to see which messages to send, and to decrypt messages received and their meaning. 
        It will familiarize you with this powerful tool.<br><br>
        About Gama Server, it's a server that starts up every time you launch GAMA, opens a websocket port and waits for clients to come and control it. 
        Gama Server Connector is an example of a client, which implements all the requests you can send to Gama Server.<br><br>

    <h2 class="with-bar-left">How to use this tool ?</h2>
    <div class="text">
        Please follow the steps below: <br>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>Check that you are connected to Gama Server, as can be seen in the Connection information section. 
                You must have CONNECTED status. 
                If this is not the case, check and, if necessary, modify the Gama Server web address in the Address section.</li>
            <li>Load the model you wish to use. To do this, enter the path to your .gaml file, and the name of the experiment 
                you wish to view in the Load An Experiment section.</li>
            <li>Launch the model by clicking on Load / Reload in the Simulation Commands section.</li>
            <li>You can check whether the model has been launched by looking at the GAMA response messages. 
                You should receive a CommandExecutedSucessfully message and have Gama State paused or launched.</li>
            <li>Click on the play button if the simulation is paused.</li>
            <li>You can check that this is working by going to GAMA GUI</li>
        </ul>
        In this following flowchart, you can see the whole process to launch a simulation remotely: <br><br>

    <h2 class="with-bar-left">FAQ</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <h3>Why sometimes I have no response when I want to load an experiment ?</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>When you reload an experiment, GAMA asks you, via an internal pop-up window, if you're sure you want to do it.
                When this happens, you must answer "yes" and GAMA will immediately respond to the loading of the results you previously sent. <br>
                If you want to avoid this probem, I suggest to set the global variable pref_experiment_ask_closing to false in the init of the global of your model.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why can't the connector connect to Gama Server?</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>I'll be very clear on this point: if you can't connect to the Gama server, it's either because you haven't specified the right connection port, 
                or because the Gama Server port hasn't been launched. In no case is it a connector problem. 
                If Gama Server hasn't launched (you have no way of checking this), go to the settings in the execution > server mode tab and disable server mode, 
                then save your preferences. Then restart it. This action resets Gama Server.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why the Gama Server simulation status is UNKNOWN when I'm connecting to Gama Server ?</h3>
        <ul class="text">
            <li>Simulation status is the state of Gama Server: is a simulation running?
                 is it paused? The connector knows this status when it receives a SimlationStatus message.
                  This message is only sent when there's a change in Gama Server status, so it's normal not to know it when you connect.
            </li>
        </ul>
