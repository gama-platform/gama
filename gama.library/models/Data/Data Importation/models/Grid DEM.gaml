/**
* Name: ASCII File to DEM Representation
* Author: Arnaud Grignard
* Description: Model to show how to import a ASCII File to make a DEM Representation and apply a Texture on it. In this 
* 	model, three experiments are presented : DEM to show the grid elevation using the ASCII File as data for the height of the 
* 	cells, and showing different 3D displays. GridDEMComplete shows more displays with the three of the previous experiment, the grid 
* 	of the cells in a 2D Display, with the Elevation but without triangulation, and the grid with text values to show the content of the 
* 	ASCII used by the cells. GraphicDEMComplete shows the use of the z_factor to amplify or reduces the difference between the z values 
* 	of a Dem geometry.
