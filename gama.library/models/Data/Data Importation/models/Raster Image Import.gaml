/**
* Name: Raster File in a Grid of cells
* Author: Maroussia Vavasseur and Benoit Gaudou
* Description: Model which shows how to import a Raster file in GAMA and use it to initialize the color attributes of a grid of cells. 
* This model represents a grid with a cell, each cell has a color, and this color is used for animals (izards) to be placed on a cell 
* that verifies some conditions. The izards do not move once they have been placed. 
* Tags:  load_file, gis, raster
