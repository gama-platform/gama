/**
* Name: urbanization_and_traffic_comodeling
* Author: HUYNH Quang Nghi
* Description: Co-model example : coupling urban growth model with the traffic model. 
* The speed of people on the road will be effected by the urbanization, more people in the region, the lower speed they move.
* And the greater urbanization the faster developping of roads.
